ex. I want a free microwave so I can pull out the transformer and make a spot welder. All I do is define the keyword "microwave" in config/settings.conf, set the city to my own ("denver"), set the category to "for sale" and "free" as the section. I want an email alert, so I set that in the alert section of the config file.
